Putting on a white belt helps to introduce newcomers to the dojo concept and its offerings.

### Practice

We practice:

* How to work in short iterations
* How to experiment with new ideas
* Healthy ways to solicit feedback from others
* Tools and techniques for deeper learning
* Dialectic approaches

### Centering

We center from core principles:

* Bias towards transparency
* Failure is equally valuable to success
* Network with peers for support
* Colocate learning investments within team backlogs
* Deliver iteratively, responsively to feedback

### Pointers

*What Learning and Development paths are available?*

At the top of page, you will see a drop down for Domains. We recommend Mindset to everyone.

*How do you read the content?*

Intersect with the Mission section of a domain first.  Then reflect on the Principle statements.  Review the Guidance instructions.  Keep note of the associated Community Circles for dialog to progress.  Under each belt level, you will see a list of resources and exercises for practice aligned for an eventual belt claim. There are also time estimates to help you plan however it could take you more or less time to complete each step.

*How to navigate the site?*

Across the top of the Dojo, you will see a navigation bar. The first drop down is Domains. From here, you will see the available domains of learning that you can progress through to level up through green, red, and black level. When you enter a domain, you'll find a description of the mission and principles for the domain, links to communities you can join and engage with, and a list of activities and learning material you'll need to complete in order to submit for a belt. You will also find estimated durations for each section to help you plan an appropriate amount of time.

*Do I have to buy the books and movies I see in the learning channels?*

We want everyone to have access to move through each domain and the ability to earn the belts along the way. We have looked for freely available resources and when possible make alternatives to paid content available, however there are some concepts that are best mastered through content that is not freely available.

### First Exercise

* Choose a domain
  * If unsure, then choose Mindset
* Make a white belt claim as detailed below

#### White Belt Claim Review Criteria

During the review of the ***White Belt Pull Request*** the following criteria will be considered and labeled accordingly:

* YAML formatting:
  * Sufficient: belt-claim-verified-yaml
  * Deficient: belt-claim-incorrect-yaml-formatting

If a Deficiency Flag (red label) appears, the request will have 30 days to be ironed out. If that time has passed and the belt claim is not able to clear, it will be closed. If at a later time the impediments have been cleared a fresh pull request can be submitted or the pull request can be re-opened.
